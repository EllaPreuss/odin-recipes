    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Homemade bread is the best kind of bread because you control the process and what goes into it. Give this bread a try! I promise it's easy.</p>
    <p>Stop buying bread and make your own, the results will surprise you!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>500 grs of all purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 packet of instant yeast</li>
        <li>350 ml of warm water</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons of olive oil (or any light oil)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, dissolve the sugar in warm water and then stir in yeast. Allow to proof until yeast resembles a creamy foam, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Mix salt and oil into the yeast. Mix in flour one cup at a time.</li>
        <li>Knead dough for 7 minutes in the bowl of your standing mixer with the dough attachment. Then, place in a well oiled bowl, and turn dough to coat in oil. Cover with a damp cloth. Allow to rise until doubled in bulk, about 30 minutes to 1 hour, depending on your room temperature.</li>
        <li>Punch dough down. Knead for 1 minute and divide in half. Shape into loaves and place into two greased 9Ã—5 inch loaf pans. Allow to rise for 30 minutes, or until dough has risen 1 inch above pans.</li>
        <li>Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 30-40 minutes.</li>
        <li>Cool, brush with butter and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This summer, try out this simple jam recipe! Only 3 ingredients required.</p>
    <p>Make jam to last you for months with a simple canning technique. This is my go-to recipe for 
    making delicious jam. Makes 3 jars, or 2 and a half, depending on your cooking time.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 kg of fresh strawberries, cleaned and sliced.</li>
        <li>500 grs of sugar.</li>
        <li>Juice of a lemon.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Clean your strawberries and cut them in small slices. Put them in a medium to big pot.</li>
        <li>Add the sugar and lemon juice. Mix together.</li>
        <li>Turn on the stove, on high heat until it starts boiling. Reduce heat to low once it boils.</li>
        <li>Cook on low heat for 30 minutes, mixing occasionally so it doesn't stick to the pot.</li>
        <li>Check the consistency on a plate. If it's too runny, cook for 10 more minutes. If it reached the desired consistency, turn the stove off.</li>
        <li>Let it cool slightly before putting it in the jars. If you didn't do the canning process, the jam will only last for a month on the shelf.</li>
    </ol>
